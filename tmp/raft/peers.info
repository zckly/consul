As of Consul 0.7.0, the peers.json file is only used for recovery
after an outage. It should be formatted as a JSON array containing the address
and port of each Consul server in the cluster, like this:

["10.1.0.1:8300","10.1.0.2:8300","10.1.0.3:8300"]

Under normal operation, the peers.json file will not be present.

When Consul starts for the first time, it will create this peers.info file and
delete any existing peers.json file so that recovery doesn't occur on the first
startup.

Once this peers.info file is present, any peers.json file will be ingested at
startup, and will set the Raft peer configuration manually to recover from an
outage. It's crucial that all servers in the cluster are shut down before
creating the peers.json file, and that all servers receive the same
configuration. Once the peers.json file is successfully ingested and applied, it
will be deleted.

Please see https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/outage.html for more information.
